Hi Dotdash team...
Greetings for the day!!!
First, thanks a lot for giving me the oppurtunity work on this exercise.
Just, I wanted to convey my plan and implementation for this project.
I did this exercise on Selenium WebDriver using Java.

My Plan:
I wanted to prsent this in simple framework structure.
Objects are in one package / class (todo.objectst.TodoObjects.java)
Based on the objects, operations are executed in another package / class (todo.operations.TodoOperation.java)
And then finally, calling the operations in "tentng" file based on test scenarios (test.todo.scenario.TodoScenario.java)
I did them all, BUT finally I faced an isue, which I couuldn't fix in this short time. Sorry for that.

Implementation:
So, I have simple stright forward approch.
All objects, operations and execution are in same file "TodoScenario_simple.java". If we execute "testng.xml", we can see the execution.

I did add all my work (working / not working codes and commented lines) in this repo for your review and let you know about my approch.
Thanks again, have a great day!
